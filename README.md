## 🍽️ Recipe Finder

## Overview:

Recipe Finder is a browser-based web application that allows users to search for recipes based on ingredients or keywords and view detailed cooking instructions. The project focuses on working with external APIs, asynchronous JavaScript, and dynamically rendering data-driven content in the UI.

This application runs entirely on the client side and does not require a backend.

## Features:

Search for recipes by keyword or ingredient

Display a list of matching recipes

View detailed recipe information (ingredients, instructions)

Dynamic UI updates based on search results

Clean and responsive layout

## Tech Stack:

HTML5 – application structure

CSS3 – layout and styling

JavaScript (ES6+) – application logic

External Recipe API – recipe data retrieval

## How to Run Locally

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/baconlord102/recipe-finder.git

Navigate into the project directory

Open index.html in your browser

No build tools or installations are required.

## Application Logic:

User input is captured through a search form

API requests are made using fetch and asynchronous JavaScript

Recipe data is parsed and mapped to UI components

Results are rendered dynamically without page reloads

Error handling ensures graceful behavior when no results are found

## What This Project Demonstrates:

Working with third-party APIs

Asynchronous JavaScript (fetch, promises)

Parsing and rendering JSON data

Dynamic DOM manipulation

Building real-world, data-driven applications

## Future Improvements:

Add loading and error states

Allow filtering by dietary restrictions

Save favorite recipes using localStorage

Add pagination or infinite scroll

Improve accessibility and keyboard navigation

## Purpose:

This project was built to move beyond static applications and demonstrate how to integrate external data sources into a front-end application using modern JavaScript patterns.
